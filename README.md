![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen)

This project uses customer data to analyze and predict credit card churn, helping a company proactively engage at-risk customers.

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- Google Sheets (EDA, pivot tables, visualization)
- SQL (MySQL) for data querying
- CSV dataset of 10,000+ customers

## ðŸ§  Project Goals
- Understand data structure
- Explore relationships
- Identify key patterns in churn behavior
- Highlight features most predictive of churn
- Deliver actionable insights to reduce churn rate

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings
- Churn rate: **16%**
- Higher churn among: low-income customers, inactive users
- Lower transaction frequency strongly correlated with churn

- ## ðŸ”Ž SQL-Driven Insights
This project uses SQL to uncover churn drivers:
- Income brackets with highest churn
- Drop in usage patterns before leaving
- High inactivity + low transactions = red flag
